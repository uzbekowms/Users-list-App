# Next Js Task

---
As I understood from the task, this was the expected implementation. There was also an option to separate the backend 
and frontend, but I didn't see much sense in that, so I combined them using the ```pages router```.

## Getting Started

---
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
